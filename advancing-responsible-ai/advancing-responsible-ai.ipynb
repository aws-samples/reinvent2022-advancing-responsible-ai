    "### 1.1 Assess bias in the world of handwritten numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and operating machine learning applications responsibly requires an active, consistent approach to prevent, assess, and mitigate bias. This workshop takes attendees through a computer vision case study in assessing unwanted bias, covering demographic group selection, evaluation dataset selection, bias metric selection, bias reporting, and root cause analysis – and concludes by discussing prevention, mitigation and communication strategies. Attendees will follow along with a Jupyter notebook. The workshop will be run by an AWS team of experts on Responsible AI that develops science, tools, and best practices to advance Responsible AI within AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will conduct experiments on a synthetic task that has parallels to real-world bias in AI: the handwritten numbers dataset. This dataset contains images of blue and orange handwritten numbers in [0,9].  In AI systems that represent people, such as face, voice, or speech recognition, we can use demographic attributes like gender, age, or race to identify groups of people. In the world of handwritten numbers, similar attributes exist. In addition to its digit identity 0-9, an instance from this dataset can be linear or curvy, orange or blue. We call the instances *handwritten numbers*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes of handwritten numbers:\n",
    "* digit = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}\n",
    "* curviness = {curvy, neutral, linear}\n",
    "* color = {orange, blue}\n",
    "\n",
    "We define our groups with these attributes. For example, \"all numbers where color==orange\" is a group. Using these groups, we can practice the bias measurement techniques that apply to real-world AI systems. We will not draw a 1:1 correspondence between numbers and people. Although this is a simplification, the handwritten numbers dataset gives us a practical and objective sandbox. \n",
